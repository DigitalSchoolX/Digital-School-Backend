# Substitute Teaching Enhanced Features

## üîÑ **MAJOR LOGIC CHANGE: From Replacement to Addition**

### Previous Logic (Replacement)
- When substitute teacher approved ‚Üí `lesson.teacher = substituteTeacherId`
- Original teacher was completely replaced
- Only substitute teacher remained in lesson
- Email used "thay th·∫ø" (replace) terminology

### **NEW LOGIC (Addition)**
- When substitute teacher approved ‚Üí `lesson.substituteTeacher = substituteTeacherId`
- Original teacher remains in `lesson.teacher`
- Both teachers participate in the lesson
- Email uses "d·∫°y b√π" (assist/support) terminology

## üöÄ **NEW ENHANCED FEATURES**

### 1. **Flexible Teacher Selection (Updated)**
- **Previous**: Only teachers without time conflicts were returned
- **NEW**: ALL teachers teaching the same subject are returned, including those with time conflicts
- **Benefit**: Users can make informed decisions about teacher selection

### 2. **Conflict Information Display**
```json
{
  "_id": "teacher_id_2", 
  "name": "Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn C",
  "email": "teacher.c@school.com",
  "subject": "subject_id_hoa",
  "subjects": ["subject_id_hoa", "subject_id_sinh"],
  "hasConflict": true,
  "conflictLesson": {
    "className": "12A3",
    "subjectName": "H√≥a h·ªçc",
    "lessonId": "LESSON_20241220_003"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Available Teachers API**
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/schedules/substitute-request/available-teachers/:lessonId`
- **Returns**: All teachers with same subject + conflict information
- **Fields Added**:
  - `hasConflict`: Boolean indicating if teacher has time conflict
  - `conflictLesson`: Details of conflicting lesson (if any)

### 4. **Dual Teacher System**
- **Main Teacher**: Remains in `lesson.teacher` field
- **Substitute Teacher**: Added to `lesson.substituteTeacher` field
- **Schedule Queries**: Updated to find lessons for both teacher types
- **Role Identification**: Teachers see their role (main/substitute) in schedule

### 5. **Updated Email Templates**
- **Terminology Change**: "d·∫°y thay" ‚Üí "d·∫°y b√π"
- **Collaborative Approach**: Emphasizes both teachers working together
- **Student Notifications**: Explain both teachers will participate

### 6. **Enhanced Schedule Service**
```javascript
// Query finds lessons for both main and substitute teachers
const lessons = await Lesson.find({
  $or: [
    { teacher: teacherId },
    { substituteTeacher: teacherId }
  ]
}).populate('teacher substituteTeacher');
```

## üìä **Database Schema Updates**

### Lesson Model Enhancement
```javascript
// Added to existing Lesson schema
substituteTeacher: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User',
  default: null
}
```

### User Model Enhancement
```javascript
// Added to support multiple subjects per teacher
subjects: [{
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'Subject'
}]
```

```

### Scenario 2: Teacher with Time Conflicts

# Should return teacher with hasConflict: true and conflictLesson details
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/schedules/substitute-request/available-teachers/LESSON_ID"
```

### Scenario 3: Dual Teacher Lesson
